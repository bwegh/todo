# stdin/out vs file handling

Currently works fine for the `list` command. For commands that "report" on
stdout the option to pipe data in is pretty much useless, because the
output would be cluttered by the report.

x Make `archive`, `push`, and `toggle` report to stderr done:2015-12-17 [4]
- Add a template for the report (e.g. "3 items archived: ...") [5]
- Add `--report`, defaulting to true, so `--no-report` can turn it off [6]
